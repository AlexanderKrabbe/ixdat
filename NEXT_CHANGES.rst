Instructions
============

Use this as a staging ground for CHANGES.rst. In other words, describe the
changes and additions to ixdat's API associated with your contribution. The idea is
that what you write here informs other developers what is on its way and then will be
copied to CHANGES.rst when the next version of ixdat is distributed. Please include
links to relevant Issues, Discussions, and PR's on github with the following format
(replace XX):

`Issue #XX <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/XX>`_

`PR #XX <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/pulls/XX>`_


For ixdat 0.2.2
===============

API Changes
-----------

- ``ECMSMeasurement.ecms_calibration_curve()`` no longer returns axes by default.
  Instead it only returns the calculated ``MSCalResult``. The axes on which the result
  is plot can be returned by setting the keyword argument ``return_axes=True``

Bug Fixes
---------

- ``ECMSMeasurement.ecms_calibration_curve()`` now plots on the correct axes when given
  ``axes_measurement``.

- Adding calibration data to a measurement with ``calibrate()`` now clears the cache.
  This ensures that calibrated series are generated when needed rather than reusing cached
  uncalibrated series.

- ``Measurement.read(... reader="zilien", technique="MS")`` now returns an
  ``MSMeasurement``. Before, the user had to import ``MSMeasurement`` and use its read
  function or they'd get the reader complaining because it couldn't find the EC data.
