changes and additions to ixdat's API associated with your contribution. The idea is
that what you write here informs other developers what is on its way and then will be
copied to CHANGES.rst when the next version of ixdat is distributed. Please include

API Changes
-----------

ixdat.measurement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Generalization of multiple calibrations:

  ``Measurement.calibration`` is deprecated in favor of ``Measurement.calibration_list``.
  A dummy calibration property is put in with a getter and setter which raise
  ``DepreciationWarning``'s. Use, e.g.:

  - ``meas.calibration_list[0]`` (replaces ``meas.calibration``).

  - ``meas.add_calibration(my_cal)`` (replaces ``meas.calibration = my_cal``).

- New method ``Measurement.calibrate(*args, **kwargs)``

  ``meas.calibrate(...)`` is a shortcut for ``meas.add_calibration(calibration_class(...))``
  where calibration_class is found by looking up ``meas.techniques`` in
  ``ixdat.technqiues.CALIBRATION_CLASSES``. For esample, if ``meas`` is an
  ``ECMSMeasurement``, calibration_class is ``ECMSCalibration``.

  Together with the generalization of multiple calibrations, this enables very flexible
  calibration. All of the following code examples work.

  1. When measurements are appended or hyphenated, all their calibrations carry over.
  This example results in ``my_ecms_meas.calibration_list`` having an
  ``ECCalibration`` and an ``MSCalibration``, both of which are accessible to ``grab``
  and plotting functions.

    >>> my_ec_meas.calibrate(RE_vs_RHE=0.715, A_el=0.196)
    >>> my_ms_meas.calibrate(ms_cal_results=[my_H2_at_M2, my_O2_at_M32])
    >>> my_ecms_meas = my_ec_meas + my_ms_meas
    >>> my_ecms_meas.plot(mol_list=["H2", "O2"])

  2. You can calibrate one measurement multiple times. When two calibrations contain the
  same parameter, the last one added is used:

    >>> my_ecms_meas = my_ec_meas + my_ms_meas
    >>> my_ecms_meas.calibrate(RE_vs_RHE=0.715, A_el=0.196)
    >>> my_ecms_meas.calibrate(ms_cal_results=[my_H2_at_M2, my_O2_at_M32])
    >>> my_ecms_meas.calibrate(RE_vs_RHE=0.656)   # overshadows the first RE_vs_RHE
    >>> my_ecms_meas.plot(mol_list=["H2", "O2"])

  3. You can calibrate all at once.

    >>> my_ecms_meas = my_ec_meas + my_ms_meas
    >>> my_ecms_meas.calibrate(
    >>>     RE_vs_RHE=0.715, A_el=0.196, ms_cal_results=[my_H2_at_M2, my_O2_at_M32]
    >>> )   # note that all of these are keyword arguments to ECMSCalibration.
    >>> my_ecms_meas.plot(mol_list=["H2", "O2"])


ixdat.techniques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Renamed measurement technique class: ``CyclicVoltammogram`` (replaces ``CyclicVoltammagram``).
  The old name is deprecated.

- Renamed properties in ``ECMeasurement`` and inheriting classes:

  - ``U_name`` (replaces ``V_str``)
  - ``J_name`` (replaces ``J_str``)
  - ``E_name`` (replaces ``E_str``)
  - ``I_name`` (replaces ``I_str``)

  The old property names are deprecated.

- Renamed keyword in ``MSMeasurement.grab_flux()`` and related methods:

  - ``remove_background`` (replaces ``removebackground``)

  The old argument name is deprecated

- ``MSCalResult.name`` is by default set to ``{mol}@{mass}``, e.g. "H2@M2" instead of
  ``{mol}_{mass}``, e.g. "H2_M2". However, you can
  use just the mol name in ``grab`` and plotting functions if a measurement has an ``MSCalResult``
  with the molecule in the ``ms_cal_list`` of one of the calibrations in its ``calibration_list``:

    >>> cal = my_ms_inlet.gas_flux_calibration(
    >>>     my_ms_measurement, mol="H2", mass="M2", tspan=[0, 20]
    >>> )
    >>> cal.name
    'H2@M2'
    >>> cal.mol
    'H2'
    >>> my_ms_measurement.calibrate(ms_cal_results=[cal])
    >>> meas.grab("n_dot_H2")
    numpy.Array([...]), numpy.Array([...])
    >>> meas.plot(mol_list=["H2"])


ixdat.plotters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Axes order: Two-panel figures with shared x-axis always return a list of axes in the order
  ``axes=[top_left, bottom_left]`` in the case of one y-axis of each panel, or
  ``[top_left, bottom_left, top_right, bottom_right]`` in the case of an additional y-axis
  in either panel. Note that ``axes[2]`` or ``axes[3]`` might be ``None``. For example,
  ``axes = ECMSPlotter.plot_measurement()`` by default results in ``axes[0]`` being the
  MS data, ``axes[1]`` electrode potential, ``axes[2]=None`` and ``axes[3]`` being the
  electrode current.

- Renamed keyword arguments in EC, EC-MS, and SEC plotting functions:

  - ``U_name`` (replaces ``V_str``)
  - ``J_name`` (replaces ``J_str``)
  - ``U_color`` (replaces ``V_color``)

  The old keyword argument names are deprecated.

- Renamed keyword argument in MS and EC-MS plotting functions:

  - ``remove_background`` (replaces ``removebackground``)

  The old argument name is deprecated

ixdat.readers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ixdat-eported .csv compatability

  The "ixdat" reader is no longer automatically compatible with .csv files exported by
  the ``IxdatCSVExporter`` of ixdat v0.1.x. You can, however, get ixdat v0.2.0 to read
  your v0.1.x .csv's by giving it a little help, in the form of aliases. For example:

     >>> meas = Measurement.read_url(
     >>>     "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixdat/tutorials/"
     >>>     + "ixdat_v0p1/loading_appending_and_saving/co_strip.csv",
     >>>     reader="ixdat",
     >>>     aliases={
     >>>         "t": ["time/s"],
     >>>         "raw_current": ["raw current / [mA]"],
     >>>         "raw_potential": ["raw potential / [V]"]
     >>>     }
     >>> )

  Can read `this file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixdat/tutorials/ixdat_v0p1/loading_appending_and_saving/co_strip.csv>
  into ixdat.

  To know which aliases to use, you should check the file and the ``essential_series_names``
  of the technique class. For example:

    >>> form ixdat.techniques import ECMeasurement
    >>> ECMeasurement.essential_series_names
    {'t', 'raw_potential', 'raw_current'}

  For even earlier .csv files (exported by ixdat version <0.1.5), you will also need to
  specify the technique.

  Starting in ixdat v0.2.0, ixdat-exported files will have the ixdat version in the header.

Bug Fixes
---------

Ixdat 0.2.0 has a number of deep improvements in data series handling, which help
fix the following bugs:


- Reliable construction of `selector` and `cycle` counters. This is done via the
  ``selector_name`` and ``_series_constructors`` class attributes, which can be
  customized for every ``Measurement`` subclass.

  This solves `#14 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/14>`_

- Carrying calibrations over through measurement combination (hyphenation or appending
  with the `+` operator) or transformation (through copying and technique-changing
  functions like `ECMeasurement.as_cv()`. This is done via replacing the use of a single
  ``Measurement.calibration`` with a ``calibration_list`` which can be appended,
  treating the ``calibration_list`` as a measurement's linked objects, and a
  ``MemoryBackend`` which stores such linked objects while the main object is being
  copied via its dictionary representation.

  This solves `#20 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/20>`_

  This also solves `#22 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/22>`_

  This also solves `#29 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/22>`_
