Instructions
============

Use this as a staging ground for CHANGES.rst. In other words, describe the
changes and additions to ixdat's API associated with your contribution. The idea is
that what you write here informs other developers what is on its way and then will be
copied to CHANGES.rst when the next version of ixdat is distributed. Please include
links to relevant Issues, Discussions, and PR's on github with the following format
(replace XX):

`Issue #XX <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/XX>`_

`PR #XX <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/pulls/XX>`_


For ixdat 0.2.2
===============

API Changes
-----------

- ``ECMSMeasurement.ecms_calibration_curve()`` no longer returns axes by default.
  Instead it only returns the calculated ``MSCalResult``. The axes on which the result
  is plotted can be returned by setting the keyword argument ``return_axes=True``

- ``MSMeasurement.grab_flux()`` can take as its first argument the name of a molecule
  for which the measurement has a calibration, but can also take a ``MSCalResult`` directly.
  As a result, MS plotting functions also accept ``MSCalResults`` in the requested
  ``mol_list``.  For example::

    cal_H2_M2 = my_ecms_meas.ecms_calibration(
        mol="H2", mass="M2", n_el=-2, tspan=[100, 200), tspan_bg=[0, 20]
    )
    t, n_dot = my_ms_meas.grab_flux(cal_H2_M2)
    my_ms_meas.plot(mol_list=[cal_H2_M2])

- Ability to change the selector increment of a measurement using
  ``Measurement.rebuild_selector``. This returns a ``ValueSeries`` which counts cumulative
  changes in specified columns (common ones include "file_number", "cycle_number", etc).
  Especially useful for compound techniques with biologic potentiostats.

- An ixdat native reader for Spectro Inlets - Zilien files has been
  implemented, as a replacement for leveraging the one in the legacy
  EC_MS project. While re-implementing it, support was also added for
  all auxiliary data series like MFC, PC, ion gauge and pirani values
  etc. Also, the Zilien tsv files can now be loaded as both EC-MS, MS
  and EC measurements, which solves some issues pertaining to
  plotting. To load a Zilien tsv file as something else than the
  default ``ECMSMeasurement``, do either:

    >>> ms_measurement = MSMeasurement.load(path_to_file="...")

  or:

    >>> ms_measurement = Measurement.load(path_to_file="...", technique="MS")

  This added functionality solves
  `Issue #31 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/31>`_

Bug Fixes
---------

- ``ECMSMeasurement.ecms_calibration_curve()`` now plots on the correct axes when given
  ``axes_measurement``.

- Adding calibration data to a measurement with ``calibrate()`` now clears the cache.
  This ensures that calibrated series are generated when needed rather than reusing cached
  uncalibrated series.

- ``Measurement.read(... reader="zilien", technique="MS")`` now returns an
  ``MSMeasurement``. Before, the user had to import ``MSMeasurement`` and use its read
  function or they'd get the reader complaining because it couldn't find the EC data.

- ``ECMeasurement["selector"]`` now correctly counts cumulative changes in file number,
  loop number, and cycle/step number. Previously there had been bugs of ignoring "cycle number"
  or "Ns" from biologic file sets if that variable wasn't included in all files, and
  including it even in file types where it is less useful as a counter (for example,
  Biologic seems to increment cycle number every time current changes sign during a
  chronoamperometric potential hold).
