Mass Spectrometry
=================

Mass spectrometry is commonly used in catalysis and electrocatalysis for two different
types of data - spectra, where intensity is taken while scanning over m/z, and
mass intensity detectin (MID) where the intensity of a small set of m/z values are
tracked in time.

The main TechniqueMeasurement class for MID data is the `MSMeasurement`.

Classes dealing with spectra are under development.
