Download Jupyter notebook tutorials
-----------------------------------
Jupyter notebooks are available in the ixdat Tutorials repository:
https://github.com/ixdat/tutorials/

This repository is a bit of a mess at the moment, apologies, but the tutorials themselves are
not bad, if we may say so ourselves. More are in progress.


Development scripts
-------------------
The basics of importing and plotting from each reader are demonstrated in
the **development_scripts/reader_testers** folder of the repository:
https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/tree/user_ready/development_scripts/reader_testers
