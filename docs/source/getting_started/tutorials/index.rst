Download Jupyter notebook tutorials
-----------------------------------
Jupyter notebooks are available in the ixdat Tutorials repository:
https://github.com/ixdat/tutorials/

This repository is a bit of a mess at the moment, apologies, but the tutorials themselves are
not bad, if we may say so ourselves. More are in progress.


Development scripts

The basics of importing and plotting from each reader are demonstrated in
the **development_scripts/reader_testers** folder of the repository:
