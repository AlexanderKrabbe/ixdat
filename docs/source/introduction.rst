Introduction
============

``ixdat`` will provides a powerful **object-oriented** interface to experimental data, especially in-situ experimental data where it is of interest to combine data obtained simultaneously from multiple techniques.

``ixdat`` will replace the existing electrochemistry - mass spectrometry data tool, `EC_MS <https://github.com/ScottSoren/EC_MS>`_, and will thus become a powerful stand-alone tool for analysis and visualization of data acquired by the equipment of `Spectro Inlets <https://spectroinlets.com>`_ and other EC-MS solutions.
It will also replace the existing electrhemistry - synchrotron GIXRD data tool, `EC_Xray <https://github.com/ScottSoren/EC_Xray>`_ when needed.
Over time, it will acquire functionality for more and more techniques.

In addition to a **pluggable** parser interface for importing your data format, it will include pluggable exporters, plotters, and database interface.

We will update this readme as features are added.

``ixdat`` is free and open source software and we welcome input and new collaborators.
